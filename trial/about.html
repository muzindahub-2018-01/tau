             <p>Farm 704 is a family farm founded by the late Mr TJN Munodawafa, it was founded in 1963 and from there it saw the rise of different modes of farming. Since the early years we have been trying to mantain the status of supporting and building the livelyhoods of some less privviledged individuals and their families through employing them as general hand workers on the farm. </p><p>We managed to inherit our grandfather's idea on farming and we are trying to mantain the farming perspectives he put on ground as a way of doing bussines and also helping our local community. You can get in touch with any of our farm management team by directly subscribing to our newsletter</p>
